# AI-assisted development rules

Use these rules for all implementation and review work in this repository.

## Think before coding
- Inspect relevant existing code, contracts, and tests before editing.
- State assumptions only when they matter; resolve uncertainty with evidence.
- Identify the smallest complete feature boundary and its verification criteria.

## Simplicity first
- Prefer direct, readable Python/TypeScript over clever abstractions.
- Reuse existing model functions and data types; do not duplicate business logic.
- Avoid speculative architecture, dependencies, and premature optimization.

## Surgical changes
- Keep changes scoped to the current deliverable.
- Preserve working behavior, interfaces, fixtures, and historical baseline.
- Fix underlying causes rather than weakening tests or hiding errors.

## Verify
- Run targeted tests and the full suite when feasible.
- Report what was actually run, what passed, and what remains unverified.
- Never claim CI, API refresh, spreadsheet parity, or production readiness without evidence.
- Do not commit API keys, credentials, or private data.

## Ship substantial increments
- Prioritize an end-to-end usable product over paperwork and micro-refinements.
- Group related implementation, tests, and integration into meaningful chunks.
- Make routine engineering decisions without interrupting for minor approvals.
- Document only decisions, setup, and operational details needed to maintain or use the system.

## Current priority
Complete reliable CFBD ingestion and connect it to deterministic ratings, projections,
predictions, and the dashboard. Retain the source spreadsheet as a read-only parity
reference until cutover is verified.
